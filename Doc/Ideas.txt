FROM FAIRLY EASY ONE TO TIME-CONSUMING ONE... :)


- Particle system: Source code availble which was acquired from internet, but runs too slowly.

                   Should optimize/remove minute factors to accelerate calculation.


- Item & Inventory: Items such as 'HP potion' can be implemeneted easily.

                    Put the item on the tile and make a player can get it.
                    
                    It is optional to make inventory when there are no equippable item.

                    Equippable items like armor or sword, maybe harder.
                    
                    Related UI can be tough, too.


- Multi-enemy Battle/Skill System: There are some incompleted code snippets about this feature.

                                   This is fairly coupled with multiplayer system and user interface.
                                   
                                   There are no turn-control system either.


- Sound System: Original author had left the team and he will not come back. Sound system is

                implemented with XACT, so anyone who want to learn the Microsoft philosophy about
                
                authoring application please contribute to this one.
                
                Almost features are works nicely, but there are some bugs on sound system.


- Skeleton Animation: The old version of Aran library has a skeleton animation feature, but

                      not on the current Aran library which is used at PoolG project.
                      
                      The old Aran library was built on 3ds Max. However, new one is based on
                      
                      Blender. Therefore you should rewrite code to make skeletal animation at
                      
                      the new Aran library. This item is very separate one, so you can implement
                      
                      this with no care about others.


- Extensible User Interface: There is too many hard coded UI snippets. No extension is possible.

                             Menu, Button, IME (for chat), etc ...
                             
                             Or just use DXUT? Mouse interface?


- Multiplayer system: Implement very simple MMORPG system to the existing PoolG.

                      Write from scratch or try to integrate RakNet engine?
                      
                      Database and/or web-site integrated system?
