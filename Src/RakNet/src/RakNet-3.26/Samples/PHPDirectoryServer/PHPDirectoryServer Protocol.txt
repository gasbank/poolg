
The Communication Protocol
==========================

Definitions
-----------

client - the RakNet game, written in C++
server - the PHP script and webserver
key - name of the column
record - all the keys and values representing a client

Updates
-------

When the client wants to update it's status with the server
it sends an HTTP POST message to the php script with a url
parameter of "update".  For example, the url would be:

	http://someserver/webgamelist.php?update

and the body of the message is a list of key=value pairs
where the pairs are seperated by ASCII 0x01 and the key
and value are seperated by ASCII 0x02.  Those two characters
cannot be contained in the keys or values.  Special fields
are:

	__GAME_LISTING_TIMEOUT - after this time you will be removed from the server
	__GAME_NAME - the name of your game
    GAME_PASSWORD_COMMAND - this may be required by the page admin to update records
    __GAME_PORT - the port # of your server: used for identification
    __DELETE_ROW - if you set this to "true", the record of your server will be removed

Key names are case-sensitive.  "Name" and "name" are different.

Reponse to Update
-----------------

The response will start with "Configuration Follows\n" and
the rest of the lines will contain a variable name, followed
by a colon and space, followed by the value, then a "\n"
character.  For example:

	Configuration follows
	title: Your game server list
	max_length: 2000
	max_timeout: 1500

Only those three fields are currenly defined.  max_length
specifies the maximum amount of characters allowed in a
record.  max_timeout is in seconds and timeouts greater
than this will become this value.  Any "\n" character will
be changed to "\r", for instance in the title.

Queries
-------

When the client wants to get a list of other clients from the
server, it sends an HTTP POST message with a url parameter of
"query".  The response will start like the response to an
update, followed by "Game List follows\n" and one record per
line, where lines are delimited by "\n" characters.

Each line is of the same form as that supplied by the client
in the update, except there are two new automaticly filled
fields and and "\n" characters will have been transformed
into "\r" characters.  The new fields are:

	__SystemAddress - the IP address of the client in the record
	__SEC_AFTER_EPOCH_SINCE_LAST_UPDATE - seconds after the epoch when this record was
	          last updated.
